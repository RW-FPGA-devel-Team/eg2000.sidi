# EACA EG2000 Colour Genie FPGA implementation for SiDi board

This core is a RW-FPGA dev team project implemented by Ricardo Martinez (KYP) initially in ZXUno.
A port to Altera has been made, covering the boards, MiST, MiSTica, SiDi and MiSTer by KYP and rampa069.
This core has been designed from scratch.

## Background
